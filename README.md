# ResumeForge

## About

In a world where people constantly tweak, refine, and over-engineer their resumes,
one tool rises to bring order to the chaos. Forget clunky Word docs, endless formatting
battles, and PDF struggles. For devs who don't know Adobe and refuse to use Canva, ResumeForge
takes your pristine JSON and forges it into polished, multilingual resume variations with a 
single command. Because your CV should evolve as fast as you.
